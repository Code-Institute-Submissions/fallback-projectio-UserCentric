# Visions of Albion band website

The aim of this website is to provide a fresh platform for Visions of Albion rather than just having pages on social media pages. The purpose is to showcase videos and photos. In addition, there is also an aim to showcase future upcoming tours for the band itself detailing times/dates and locations. 
 
## UX
 
Who is the website for?

A duo called Visions of Albion that consists of two members; Daniel and Samantha.

Who is the target audience?

The target audience will be fans of the duo who will want to be able to view the detailing, history and any videos/music that the duo will have to offer.

The initial plan was to start the website from scratch by using a plan drawn up on hard copy paper and then to build it on the website. Although substantial progress was made it came to be that making the project responsive proved too much of a demanding task and it would be more prudent to seek out a template that was already available on w3schools which had been specifically tailored to accommodate a musical group.
User actions – 
•	Be able to select sections via the nav bar and access the sections respective to the section name.
•	Be able to play YouTube videos within the site to view VOA songs/videos.
•	Showcase the band and its history through slideshow on the first section.
•	Showcase individuals from the duo on the band section via two separate photos and a caption pointing out who is who.
•	Have social media links that will be able to point anywhere but also to point more particularly to the bands Facebook page.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- To implement a shop. The idea was scrapped due to the fact that it did not add anything to the project in terms of HTML and CSS. I am hopeful that in the future this shop will be implemented.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- html: the core language of the site. placeholder for elements to see but is not near without CSS.
- css : used to beautify the website and make it look and feel more user friendly
- bootstrap : the grid system was utilised in order to make the content resonsive to any particular screen size.




## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Youtube videos:
    1. Click on the video. 
    2. See if it plays or returns the message that says 'this content cannot be played.

2. Nav links
    1. click on the links to see if they go to the respective sections 
    2. if not rectify h ref in code

3. social media buttons
    1. hover over the social media links 
    2. see if only one when clicks takes you directly to respective social media page 
    3. If only a the facebook link should take you to the facebook page then proceed to mark it off 
    4. If all the links have done this then make sure that the anchor tags and other attributes are encapsulated properly
    5. That the outcome of clicking the link will open the url in a new tab.
## Deployment

The site will be deployed through the master branch. 

I did run into a problem with deploying the site as the content was not being displayed on the deployed version of the site but was overcome by renaming the project name and including an io.

The site will be ran locally through clicking the html file on the desktop.


## Credits

### Content


### Media
Images were extracted from the Visions of Albion facebook page and the videos were incorporated through youtube using iframes.

### Acknowledgements
Thank you to w3Schools for providing snippets of code so that I could implement them into the site duch as the form for the contact section within tours and shows, automatic slideshow and many others. They have been respectively cited within the html and css files.
