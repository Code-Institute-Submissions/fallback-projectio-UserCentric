        <h2>About Dan & Sam</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to the Visions of Albion website. Our duo consists of myself (Dan) and my better half Sam.
        
            <br>
            <br> We have started this website in the hope it shows a fresh perspective in comparison to our pages on respective social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and be able to put our stamp, our image.
            <br>
            <br> We hope to publish our past recordings in the form of videos on the site as well as implmenting a functioning shop so that our merchandise will be available for you to purchase.
            <br>
            <br> In addtion, we hope to have a page dedicated to detailing us as a duo in further detail which will summarise our history, our present and also what we will be intending to do in the future such as gigs and other future endeavours.<br>Visions of Albion are a Liverpool-based duo formed in 2017. Currently recording their first EP, Visions of Albion have went from strength to strength. So far, they have earned spots at acclaimed events such as playing ‘Light Night’ 2019’ at Liverpool Philharmonic music room, Liverpool Acoustic’s ‘Songwriting Challenge’ and supporting ex-Inspiral Carpets’ frontman Tom Hingley - their unique blend of harmonies and guitar being described as ‘English Folk meets Laurel Canyon’.</p>
